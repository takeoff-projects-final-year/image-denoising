# image-denoising
Image denoising is the process of removing noise from digital images. It is a common problem in image processing, where the aim is to remove or reduce unwanted artifacts, or "noise," that degrade the quality of an image.

Noise can arise from a variety of sources, including sensor noise, compression artifacts, and interference from other sources. Image denoising algorithms aim to remove these unwanted artifacts while preserving the important features of the image, such as edges and textures.

Image Denoising Useful For?
There are many different techniques for Image Denoising, ranging from simple spatial filtering methods to more advanced algorithms based on statistical models or deep learning. Some popular methods include median filtering, wavelet transforms, and total variation denoising.

Image denoising is a common task in digital image processing and is used by a wide range of people and industries. Here are some examples of who might use image denoising:

•	Photographers: Photographers may use image denoising techniques to remove unwanted noise from their images and improve their overall quality.
•	Medical professionals: Medical professionals may use image denoising techniques to improve the clarity of medical images, such as X-rays or MRI scans.
•	Video game designers: Video game designers may use image denoising techniques to create high-quality graphics for their games.
•	Film industry professionals: Film industry professionals may use image denoising techniques to remove noise from film footage and improve the overall quality of the final product.
•	Security personnel: Security personnel may use image denoising techniques to improve the clarity of surveillance footage and make it easier to identify individuals or objects in the footage.
•	Scientists and researchers: Scientists and researchers may use image denoising techniques to improve the quality of images used in their research, such as in microscopy or astronomy.

Overall, image denoising is a useful tool for anyone who works with digital images and wants to improve their quality.
